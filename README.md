# Tang Nano 9K

step-wise development towards a RISC-V rv32i implementation supporting cache of PSRAM

## todo
```
[x] step 9: read from flash, write to cache
[ ] step 10: implement ram interface
[x]   writing to UART address triggers cache fetch line
      => cache.enable added
[ ] step 11: adapt riscv core
```
